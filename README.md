 -using cost tracking tools such as trello
 -scope management, avoiding unnecessary feature addition
 -Accurate Budgeting – Estimate costs realistically, including contingencies

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
agile has a more iterative and agile approach while waterfall has a linear and structured approach
agile evolves over time while waterfall has a clear structure

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
agile is more beneficial in projects that frequently require change and user feedback such as social medial platforms and fintech apps.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
some of the methods for ensuring quality assurance are
  -Clear Requirements – Define expectations from the start.
  -Code Reviews – Regular peer reviews to catch errors early.
